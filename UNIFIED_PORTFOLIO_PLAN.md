- Finance Trading App (SOX compliance)
- Pharma Manufacturing App (GMP compliance)
- Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
- ArgoCD GitOps
- K3s Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL Database
- All Docker Containers
- Host System Metrics

### What It Captures
- Complete container states
- Network connections
- Memory usage by process
- 30 minutes of logs
- Compliance status (FDA/SOX/GMP)
- Cryptographic chain of custody

### Key Files
- `/scripts/forensic_collector.py` - Core collector
- `/scripts/forensic_api.py` - Web interface
- `/kubernetes/forensic-collector-daemonset.yaml` - K3s deployment
- `/docker/Dockerfile.forensic` - Container image

## Demo Scenarios (UPDATED WITH DR)

### START WITH THIS - The Money Shot (30 seconds)
```bash
# Open the Evidence Chain Viewer first
open http://localhost:8888

# Say: "Let me show you something no other candidate has built..."
# Show the forensic evidence chain with multiple incidents already captured
# Point out the cryptographic hashes linking each incident
```

### Demo 1: Disaster Recovery Test (THE WINNER - 2 minutes)
```bash
# Show your DR test report
cat /home/ubuntu/DISASTER_RECOVERY_PROOF.txt

# Say: "I've tested complete server failure. Here's the forensic evidence 
# showing recovery in 28 minutes with zero data loss. The evidence chain 
# remained cryptographically intact throughout the disaster."

# Show the evidence of the DR test itself
open http://localhost:8888
# Point to incidents: dr_test_start and dr_test_complete
```

### Demo 2: Live LIMS FDA Incident (if asked)
```bash
kubectl delete pod lims-backend-xxxxx
# Watch real-time evidence capture with FDA compliance preservation
# Show the new incident appear in the chain viewer
```

### Demo 3: Finance SOX Violation (optional)
```bash
docker exec finance-app stress --vm 1 --vm-bytes 1G
# Captures memory spike with transaction state
```

## Interview Talking Points

### Your REFINED Elevator Pitch
"I built a production-grade DevOps portfolio with a unique twist - forensic evidence collection. Drawing from my forensic science background, I created a system that monitors all applications and infrastructure, automatically preserving complete system state when incidents occur.

This includes three production applications - an FDA-compliant LIMS, a financial trading system, and a pharmaceutical manufacturing app - each with different deployment strategies. What makes it unique is the forensic collector that captures everything with cryptographic chain of custody.

Let me show you... [start demo]. This isn't from any tutorial - this is innovation based on my forensic background where evidence integrity is critical."

### Why You're Different
1. **Forensic Methodology:** Applied evidence preservation to DevOps
2. **System-Wide Monitoring:** Not just one app, but everything
3. **Compliance Ready:** FDA, SOX, GMP evidence automatically preserved
4. **Production Thinking:** Tailscale over SSH tunnels, Loki over Elasticsearch
5. **Cost Optimized:** 95% savings vs cloud ($25 vs $500/month)

### Handling Skeptical Questions

**Q: "Isn't this overkill for a home lab?"**
A: "It demonstrates production thinking. In real environments, evidence collection saves hours of debugging and satisfies auditors. I'd rather show what I can build than just talk about it."

**Q: "How is this different from normal logging?"**
A: "Logs show what happened. This preserves the entire system state with cryptographic proof - like a crime scene vs a witness statement. When your CEO asks why the trading system went down, you have forensic-grade evidence."

**Q: "Did you follow a tutorial for this?"**
A: "No, this is my innovation. The forensic methodology comes from my science background. I combined that with DevOps practices to create something unique. Let me show you the evidence chain..."

**Q: "What about disaster recovery?"**
A: "I've tested complete server failure three times. Recovery takes under 30 minutes with zero data loss. The forensic collector even captured the recovery process itself. Here's the proof... [show DR report]"

### The Money Quote
"While other candidates show basic deployments, I've built something unique. When any incident occurs - LIMS failure, trading app memory leak, deployment error - my forensic collector has already preserved the complete system state with legal chain of custody. This came from my forensic science background where you get ONE chance to collect evidence properly."

## Cost Breakdown
- EC2 t2.micro: $8.50/month
- Home electricity: ~$15/month

## Priority Order (If Time Constrained)
If you hit issues, prioritize:
1. **Day 1-2:** Get LIMS running (core application)
2. **Day 4:** Get forensic collector working (your differentiator)
3. **Day 5:** Get EC2 gateway up (demo accessibility)
4. Everything else is bonus

## Success Metrics for Interview
- [ ] Can demo forensic evidence chain viewer smoothly
- [ ] Can trigger and explain incident capture
- [ ] Can answer skeptical questions confidently
- [ ] Have practiced demo 10+ times
- [ ] Can explain every architectural decision

## Final Reality Check
- **Timeline:** 6 days is aggressive but achievable
- **Must use:** Tailscale (not SSH tunnels), Loki (not Elasticsearch)
- **Accept:** Some things won't be perfect - that's OK
- **Focus:** Demo quality matters more than perfection
- **Practice:** The demo until it's muscle memory

## Expected Interview Outcomes
- **Phone screens:** 90% pass rate
- **Technical interviews:** You'll stand out immediately
- **Salary:** $95-110k starting (vs $85-95k without this)
- **Growth:** $125k+ within a year
- **Why:** No other candidate has forensic evidence collection

## IMPORTANT: Next Steps
1. Copy this file to LIMS project directory
2. Copy this file to Zero-Downtime Pipeline directory
3. When working on any project, reference this plan
4. All three projects work together as one portfolio
5. **The Forensic Collector is your golden ticket - build it first after core apps**

## The Interview Winner Statement
When they ask about production readiness:

**"I've tested disaster recovery three times. My forensic evidence collector even captured the recovery process itself. Here's the evidence showing Server 1 failure at 14:30, automatic failover initiated, and full recovery by 14:58 with zero data loss. The evidence chain's cryptographic integrity survived the entire disaster."**

This transforms you from "has home lab" to "thinks like an SRE who's been paged at 3 AM."

## Disaster Recovery Architecture
```
BACKUP STRATEGY:
Server 1 → Server 2 (Real-time replication)
         ↓
      EC2 (Critical evidence only)
         ↓
   GitHub (All configs in Git)
         ↓
   DockerHub (Container images)

RECOVERY PROCEDURE:
1. K3s restore from snapshot (5 min)
2. Apps redeploy from GitOps (10 min)
3. Evidence restore from replica (5 min)
4. Health verification (5 min)
Total: <30 minutes

TESTED: 3+ times before interview
PROVEN: Zero data loss
```

## One Final Tip
**Practice the demo until it's smooth.** The technical implementation is 50%, but your ability to demonstrate it confidently is the other 50%. Record yourself doing the demo and refine it until you can do it in your sleep.

**NEW: Run the disaster recovery test at least 3 times before your interview. Have the proof ready to show.**
