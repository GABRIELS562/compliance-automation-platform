# Digital Evidence Pipeline (DEP)

## 🔬 Forensic-Grade DevOps Monitoring System

**A production system that applies 15 years of DNA forensic laboratory principles to DevOps infrastructure monitoring and compliance.**

### What This Repository Does

This repository contains a forensic evidence collection system that monitors DevOps infrastructure using the same rigorous chain-of-custody and evidence integrity principles required in DNA forensic laboratories. It's not just monitoring - it's legally-defensible evidence collection that tracks every deployment, validates compliance in real-time, and maintains cryptographic proof of system states.

The system is currently deployed on AWS EC2 and actively monitoring three production applications (LIMS, Finance, Pharma) for regulatory compliance including FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SOX, and GMP standards.

## 🟢 Current Status: OPERATIONAL

- **Deployment**: AWS EC2 (Mumbai Region)
- **Uptime**: 30+ days continuous operation
- **Metrics Endpoint**: Port 9999
- **Active Process**: `forensic_complete.py`
- **Dashboard**: Grafana "Regulatory Compliance Scores"

## 🔬 Forensic Principles Applied

### 1. **Chain of Custody**
Every piece of evidence (deployment, configuration change, metric) is tracked with:
- Timestamp
- Source system
- SHA256 hash
- Digital signature

### 2. **Evidence Integrity**
- Cryptographic hashing of all collected data
- Immutable audit logs
- Tamper detection mechanisms

### 3. **Contamination Prevention**
- Security scanning at collection points
- Isolated evidence storage
- Verification before processing

### 4. **Court-Admissible Standards**
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for electronic records
- SOX compliance for financial systems
- GMP validation for pharmaceutical processes

## 🚀 Deployment

### Current Production Deployment
```bash
# The system is currently running as:
cd /home/ubuntu/digital-evidence-pipeline
nohup python3 forensic_complete.py > forensic.log 2>&1 &

# Accessible at:
http://100.101.99.93:9999/metrics  # Metrics endpoint
```

### To Deploy Fresh
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/GABRIELS562/digital-evidence-pipeline.git
cd digital-evidence-pipeline

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the collector
python3 forensic_complete.py
```

### Docker Deployment (Alternative)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-ec2.yml up -d
```

## 📈 Business Value

- **Audit Readiness**: 100% automated compliance documentation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Real-time detection prevents violations before they occur
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminates manual audit preparation (saves ~40 hours/month)
- **Legal Protection**: Court-admissible evidence trail for all operations

---

## 🔍 What Makes This Different

Traditional monitoring tells you what happened. This system preserves the entire "crime scene":
- Complete system state at incident time
- All related configurations
- Network connections
- Process trees
- With cryptographic proof of integrity

Just like DNA evidence that can exonerate or convict years later, this system maintains evidence that would hold up in court.

**Gabriel S.**  
*15 Years Forensic Science | MBA | AWS Solutions Architect | DevOps Engineer*

> "In the forensics lab, contaminated evidence means a criminal walks free. In DevOps, contaminated deployments mean production goes down. I built this system to ensure neither happens."

From processing DNA evidence in criminal cases to building resilient cloud infrastructure, I bring a unique perspective where precision isn't just best practice—it's the only practice.
