# Compliance Automation Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates the transition from forensic scientist to DevOps engineer by automating compliance, audit, and risk management for highly regulated industries such as finance and pharmaceuticals. It provides a full-stack solution for compliance monitoring, reporting, and validation, leveraging both forensic investigation principles and modern DevOps practices.

## Objectives
- Automate compliance controls and validation for regulatory frameworks (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SOX, PCI-DSS)
- Provide forensic-grade audit trails and evidence collection
- Enable real-time compliance scoring and risk assessment
- Deliver executive-level dashboards for business value
- Support continuous integration and automated testing of compliance controls

## From Forensics to DevOps: Skills Translation
- **Evidence Collection → Automated Audit Trails:** Forensic rigor in log collection, chain-of-custody, and tamper-evidence is applied to infrastructure-as-code and cloud environments.
- **Investigation & Analysis → Compliance Scoring:** Analytical skills are used to design metrics, scoring algorithms, and validation scripts for compliance posture.
- **Reporting → Executive Dashboards:** Experience in communicating findings is translated into business-focused Grafana dashboards and automated reporting.
- **Quality Assurance → Automated Testing:** Forensic attention to detail is leveraged in Molecule scenarios, validation scripts, and integration tests.

## Industry-Specific Value Proposition
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Automates FDA 21 CFR Part 11 controls, electronic signatures, data integrity, and audit readiness.
- **Finance:** Implements SOX and PCI-DSS controls, financial data access logging, privilege escalation tracking, and regulatory audit support.
- **Business Value:** Reduces compliance costs, increases audit readiness, and provides real-time risk visibility for executives.

## Technical Architecture
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Ansible playbooks for compliance controls, Terraform for AWS cloud deployment, Docker Compose for local development.
- **Monitoring & Reporting:** Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, Elasticsearch for audit log storage.
- **Automated Validation:** Molecule for playbook testing, Python scripts for compliance rule validation, integration pipeline for end-to-end QA.
- **Cloud Compliance:** AWS Config and CloudTrail for cloud-native audit and configuration monitoring.

## Installation & Usage

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd docker && docker-compose up --build`
3. Access:
   - Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (admin/admin)
   - Prometheus: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
   - Compliance Metrics: [http://localhost:8000/metrics](http://localhost:8000/metrics)
   - Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Edit `terraform/main.tf` and set `compliance_monitor_image` variable
3. `cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply`

### Testing & Validation
- Run automated tests: `cd tests && ./test_pipeline_integration.sh`
- Review compliance scores and validation output

## Business Case for Compliance Automation
- **Reduce Audit Costs:** Automated evidence collection and validation reduce manual effort and audit preparation time.
- **Increase Audit Readiness:** Continuous monitoring and scoring ensure organizations are always ready for regulatory review.
- **Mitigate Risk:** Real-time detection of policy violations and risk scoring enables proactive remediation.
- **Executive Visibility:** Business-focused dashboards translate technical compliance into actionable business insights.
