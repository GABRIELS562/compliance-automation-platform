markdown# Digital Evidence Pipeline (DEP)

## Forensic-Grade DevOps Audit System

Applying 15 years of DNA forensic laboratory principles to DevOps infrastructure monitoring and compliance.

### ðŸ”¬ From DNA Lab to DevOps Lab

For 15 years, I processed DNA evidence where chain of custody wasn't optionalâ€”it was legally required. Every sample was tracked, every transfer documented, every result defensible in court. This project brings those same forensic principles to DevOps infrastructure.

### Core Forensic Principles

- **Chain of Custody**: Every deployment tracked from commit to production with cryptographic verification
- **Evidence Integrity**: SHA256 hashing and digital signatures ensure tamper-proof audit trails
- **Contamination Prevention**: Security scanning at every stage prevents "contaminated" deployments
- **Court-Admissible Standards**: Documentation meets regulatory compliance (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SOX, GMP)

### The Evidence Processing Pipeline
Git Commit (Evidence Intake) â†’ Security Scan (Contamination Check) â†’
Build (Processing) â†’ Test (Quality Control) â†’ Deploy (Evidence Release)

Each stage maintains complete traceability, just like DNA evidence moving through a forensics lab.

### Technical Implementation

- **Evidence Collection Agent**: Monitors K8s clusters, captures system state during incidents
- **Chain of Custody Database**: Immutable audit log with cryptographic verification
- **Forensic Analysis Dashboard**: Real-time compliance scoring and anomaly detection
- **Compliance Engine**: Automated validation against FDA, SOX, GMP standards

### Architecture

- **Languages**: Python, Go, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, ArgoCD
- **Cloud**: AWS, Hybrid on-premise

### Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GABRIELS562/digital-evidence-pipeline.git

# Deploy with Terraform
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform apply

# Access the Evidence Dashboard

Business Value

Reduce Audit Costs: Automated evidence collection eliminates manual audit preparation
100% Compliance Ready: Continuous monitoring ensures constant audit readiness
Zero-Trust Verification: Every change cryptographically verified
Risk Mitigation: Real-time detection prevents compliance violations

The Forensic Difference
Traditional monitoring tells you what happened. This system preserves the entire crime sceneâ€”system state, configurations, logs, and metricsâ€”with chain of custody that would hold up in court.

From analyzing DNA evidence in criminal cases to building resilient cloud infrastructure, I bring a unique perspective to DevOpsâ€”where precision isn't just best practice, it's the only practice.

"In forensics, contamination means a criminal walks free. In DevOps, it means production goes down. Neither is acceptable."
