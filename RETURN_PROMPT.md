**"I'm ready to dive deep into this compliance automation platform to learn and practice DevOps/SRE fundamentals. I want to start with the Quick Start guide to get hands-on experience with monitoring, alerting, health checks, and incident response. 

Please guide me through:
1. Deploying the complete SRE platform locally 
2. Understanding the core concepts in the `/sre` folder
3. Practicing real incident response scenarios
4. Building practical skills I can showcase to employers

I have the platform code ready and want to focus on learning the fundamental SRE concepts that will help me get an entry-level DevOps/SRE job."**
